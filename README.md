# Capstone Project

My senior capstone project was a research/product fusion. I studied game programming in high-level languages and developed a level of a 2D platforming game in Python, using various Pygame modules.

The source code is Northeastern State University proprietary and cannot be shared, according to school policy. What you see in this repository is the capstone poster, accompanying paper, and PowerPoint presentation. The poster and paper both contain code snippets. These combined should give you a fairly intimate view of my capstone project.
